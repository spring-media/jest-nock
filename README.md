# jest-nock

_Automate request/SSE traffic recording and replay for tests._

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/jest-nock.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/jest-nock)
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/PortBlueSky/jest-nock/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

Instead of mocking requests or setting up nock for every test manually,
this setup allows to flag tests that make requests to other systems and
automatically record and replay requests made during a test run.
After recording the requests for your test suite, it will never make real network requests again, so you don't need these external systems available during a test run and your test suite will run much faster, while still ensuring your project integrates well will the used APIs.

## Example

```js
it.nock('uses some method that makes requests to external services', () => async () => {
    const result = await makeSomeRequest();
    expect(result).toBe(derivate);
});
```

## Install

```shell
yarn add jest-nock
```

To use `jest-nock` with your jest setup, add it to your [testFramework file setup](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html#setuptestframeworkscriptfile-string). Based on what test runner you are using, you might have to tweak your setup. Have a look at how the tests are setup in this repository.

### Jasmine (default)

```js
const { upgradeJasmine } = require('jest-nock');

upgradeJasmine(global, options);
```

### Circus

Circus does not expose a test file path like `jasmine.testPath`,
using this method `global.__TESTPATH` needs to be set manually.

```js
const { upgradeCircus } = require('jest-nock');

upgradeCircus(global, options);
```

### Global Options

- `nockOptions: Object` - see **API - Nock Options**
- `writeAfterEach: boolean` - writes out the recordings after each test case (used for testing the tool itself).
- `loadAfterEach: boolean` - loads the recordings file before each test case (used for testing the tool itself).

## Usage

- Mark a test to be recorded/replayed with `it.nock(...)`
- Wrap your test method in another function `it.nock(..., () => () => { ... })`
- Set `JEST_NOCK_RECORD=true` in your environment _and_ run the tests you want to record against some real/mock/test API.
- Run your tests without the env variable or `JEST_NOCK_RECORD=false` and see that no real requests are being made.

Recorded requests will be stored in a folder called `__nocks__` next to the file containing the test/suite.

For detailed examples, have a look at the [tests for the tool itself](./jest-nock.test.js).

## API

### Nock Options

Options for recording and replay can be set globally via one of the setup methods (_upgradeJasmine_, _upgradeCircus_) or as the last argument to a test runner method like this:

```js
test.nock('should...', () => () => { /* ... */ }, nockOptions);
```

**Options:**

- `removeHeaders: string[]` - removes the specified headers from API recordings and will therefor not replay them.
- `title: string` - overrides the title for the test, which will be used as a key in the recordings (used for testing the tool itself).
